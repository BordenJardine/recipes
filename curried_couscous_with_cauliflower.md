# Curried Couscous, Carrots, and Cauliflower
Cold or caliente!

## Ingredients
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- ½ pound Israeli (pearl) couscous
- 3 ⅓ cups water
- 2 tablespoons light brown sugar
- ½ tablespoon curry powder
- ¾ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon ground coriander
- ¼ teaspoon ground cumin
- ½ teaspoon cayenne pepper
- ½ head cauliflower
- 1 small carrot (peeled & cut into small cubes)
- ½ cup mayonnaise
- 1½ tablespoons cilantro (minced)
- 2 limes

## Directions
- In a medium pot over medium-high heat, add 1 tablespoon olive oil. Add couscous and cook until lightly toasted, about 3 – 4 minutes. Add 3 ⅓ cups water. Season with salt and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover and simmer 5 – 6 minutes, or until the couscous is tender. Drain and rinse under cold water. Drain well and transfer to a large mixing bowl.
- Preheat the oven to 450˚F. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
- In a small bowl, combine brown sugar, curry powder, turmeric, salt, coriander, cumin, & cayenne pepper. Blend well.
- In another small bowl, toss the carrots with ½ tablespoon olive oil and ¼ of the spices.
- For the cauliflower, cut or break the florets into small pieces, about ½-inch. In a large bowl, toss the florets with 1½ tablespoons olive oil and rest of the spices.
- Transfer the carrots to one side on the prepared baking sheet. Transfer the cauliflower florets to the other side of the baking sheet. Roast in the oven. After 8 minutes, check if the carrots are tender. If they are, transfer them into the bowl of couscous. Return the cauliflower to the oven and roast for another 4 – 6 minutes. Transfer them into the bowl of couscous.
- Toss everything together and blend with mayonnaise. Taste and adjust with additional spice if desired. (More spicy!)
- Enjoy hot, or chill for at least 1 hour in the fridge to serve cold. When ready to serve, top each plate with cilantro and a lime wedge.
