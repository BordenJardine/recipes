# Squish Squash: Sweet & Savory
Dinner and dessert!

## Sweet Ingredients
- 1/2 medium acorn squash, seeded
- butter
- sugar or maple syrup
- cinnamon
- nutmeg
- ginger
- allspice
- salt
- cardamom
- clove

## Savory Ingredients
- 1/2 medium acorn squash, seeded
- 1/4 onion, finely diced
- fresh garlic, 2-3 cloves
- olive oil
- paprika (half sharp or Hungarian)
- turmeric
- salt/pepper OR ras el hanout and salt/pepper OR tandoori spice and cayenne and salt OR za'atar and pepper OR rosemary and thyme, fresh if you have it

## Directions
- Preheat oven to 400°F.
- Wash the squash.
- Slice in half stem to end.  If the squash is too hard, microwave for about 3 minutes and then let it cool. This softens the skin, making it easier to cut.
- Scoop out the seeds.
- Season the sweet side: Melt the butter and mix with cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, allspice.  Add a pinch of salt.  Add half as much cardamom and clove as you did cinnamon. Sprinkle with sugar after rubbing with spices, or mix in some maple syrup with the spices.
- Season the savory side: Mix the onion, garlic, olive oil, and spices.  Spread on squash.
- Bake for 50-60 minutes at 400°F or until fork tender.  Cook the savory half face up and the sweet half face down. To minimize dishes, line the pan with parchment paper.
