Ramen Nude-Ls!
==============

Serves 4

Prep time: 1 hour 45 minutes | Inactive time: 1 hour | Total time: 2 hours 45 minutes

## Ingredients:
- 2 teaspoons kansui or baked baking soda (see step 2 below)
- 3/4 cup lukewarm water
- 3 cups flour

## Directions:
If you are using baked baking soda, then follow this procedure. If you are using kansui, then skip to step 3. 
- Heat the oven to 250 degrees F.
- Into a small baking pan, place the baking soda. 
- Bake for 1 hour.
- Let it cool. 
- Note: You can bake more than what's needed for this recipe for future use. Just store the excess in a tightly sealed container to prevent it from absorbing moisture, in a place where it can keep for a long time. Do not touch, as it can irritate.
- In a small glass bowl, mix the baked baking soda and water. Mix well, until the baking soda is completely dissolved.
- Into a large bowl, pour the flour, and make a well in the center.
- Pour the water with the baking soda into the well, and with a spoon, mix well. You will have a crumbly dough that might seem like it needs water, but don't add water. It just needs patience and a lot of mixing to become a more compact dough.
- Once you see that the dough is becoming compact, use your hands to knead it more. It's a tough dough. Knead until you have a compact ball, and then transfer it to a work table.
- On the table, using a rolling pin, flatten the dough, and fold it a few times. It is quite a tough dough, so put a lot of energy into it. Wrap it in cling wrap, and let it rest at room temperature for 1 hour.
- After 1 hour, pass the rolling pin over the dough again a few times, and then divide it into 4 equal pieces. Flatten each piece with the rolling pin.
- Try to roll out a long thin dough.
- Cut that shit with a knife real thin.
- When ready to cook, bring a pot of water to a boil, and cook the noodles for 2 to 3 minutes. Mix in with the soup of your choice.
