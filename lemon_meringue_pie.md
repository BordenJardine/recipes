Prebake:
https://blog.kingarthurflour.com/2015/11/23/blind-bake-pie-crust/

1.  Place your crust in the pan, and crimp the edge. Line the crust with a parchment round (9″, for a 9″ pie), or paper coffee filter.
2.  Add pie weights, dry rice, dried beans or (as I’ve done here) dry wheat berries, enough to fill the pan 2/3 full. Chill the crust for 30 minutes; this will solidify the fat, which helps prevent shrinkage.
3.  Bake in a preheated 375°F oven for 20 minutes.
4.  Remove the pie from the oven, and lift out the paper and weights. Prick the bottom of the crust all over with a fork, to prevent bubbles. Return the crust to the oven and bake for an additional 15 to 20 minutes, until the crust is golden all over.


Filling:

- 1 (2) cup white sugar 
- 2 (4) tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 3 (0.375c) tablespoons cornstarch
- 1/4 (1/2) teaspoon salt
- 1 1/2 (3) cups water
- 2 (4) lemons, juiced and zested
- 2 (4) tablespoons butter
- 4 (8) egg yolks, beaten
- 1 (2) (9 inch) pie crust, baked
- 4 (8) egg whites
- 6 (0.75cups) tablespoons white sugar

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
To Make Lemon Filling: In a medium saucepan, whisk together 1 (2) cup sugar, flour, cornstarch, and salt. Stir in water, lemon juice and lemon zest. Cook over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until mixture comes to a boil. Stir in butter. Place egg yolks in a small bowl and gradually whisk in 1/2 (1) cup cup of hot sugar mixture. Whisk egg yolk mixture back into remaining sugar mixture. Bring to a boil and continue to cook while stirring constantly until thick. Remove from heat. Pour filling into baked pastry shell.

To Make Meringue (do this after the filling is done!): In a large glass or metal bowl, whip egg whites until foamy. Add sugar gradually, and continue to whip until stiff peaks form. Spread meringue over pie, sealing the edges at the crust.

Bake in preheated oven for 10 minutes, or until meringue is golden brown.
